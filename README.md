# GoldenUI
Ui Lib for Angular &amp; React

# Why create a new UI Lib ?
Because every Library is different in look, I cannot use one librarya to create diff, layout, and libs like tailwind don't give wide range of components & customisability. 

# Features 
 - A Component Library which should be cross platform (Angular / React)
 - Easy to Use 
 - Enterprise Grade (Wide range of components) 
 - Fully Customisable (Should work with different Design Systems, Goal is that we should be able to incorporate all design system with one lib).
